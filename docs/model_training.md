## ⚙️ YOLOv5 Model Training

### Configuration
- **Config file**: `yolov3_ts_train.cfg`
- **Model**: YOLOv5s
- **Image size**: 416X416
- **Batch size**: 16
- **Epochs**: 100

### Training Procedure
A training script is executed, specifying the dataset path, pre-trained weights (e.g., yolov5s.pt), and other hyperparameters.

Training progresses through epochs, optimizing object classification and bounding box regression.

### Training Command
```bash
!wandb disabled
!python train.py 
--img 415 
--batch 16 
--data /kaggle/working/dataset/dataset.yaml 
--weights yolov5s.pt 
--cache 
--workers 2
```

### Output
A set of learned weights stored in a best.pt file, representing the model with highest validation performance.

These weights are later used for inference on unseen test images.


## ⚙️ CNN Classification Model Training

### ✅ Objective
To build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that classifies cropped traffic sign images into one of the 43 predefined classes.

### Data Preparation
**Images** are resized to **32×32** pixels to ensure consistent input shape.

**Normalization** is performed to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.

The dataset is split into training and test subsets to evaluate model generalization.

###  CNN Architecture

The model uses __3 convolutional layers__ with increasing filters (32 → 64 → 128) and max pooling for spatial downsampling.

A fully connected dense layer maps the extracted features to the 43 output classes via a softmax layer.

Activation functions like ReLU introduce non-linearity, aiding learning of complex patterns.


### Training Process
It is evaluated on a hold-out test set to report classification accuracy.
```bash

loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {acc*100:.2f}%")
     
```

### Save the CNN Model

A trained CNN model capable of recognizing traffic sign types with high accuracy.

The final model is saved for future inference or export.

This document summarizes the training pipeline for both detection and classification of traffic signs using YOLOv5 and CNNs.
